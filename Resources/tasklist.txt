- Gather data
	- Planet scaling - based on sun of 1.0 (done in Mesh::loadMesh())
	- Math for orbit paths and speed (done with glm::translate)
	- Math for rotation (speed and axis)
	- Moons with scaling, orbit paths and speed, rotation 
- Function to zoom into planets - LookAt function?
- Saturn's rings (make in blender with general planet model, apply Saturn's scaling)
- Background
- Implementing two programs (scaled and actual)
- Updating readme and create user manual


Extra stuff
- Draw orbit paths
- Rotate saturn's rings
- Other rings?
